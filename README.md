**Text to Columns:** Combined data points in a single column were split using the Text to Columns function, ensuring each value was properly categorized.
**Date Formatting:** Inconsistent date entries were corrected, with all dates standardized to a uniform date format for accurate time-based analysis.
**Standard Table Conversion: **The dataset was transformed into a structured Excel table to enable easier management, automation, and dynamic analysis.
These steps helped transform the raw dataset into a clean, structured foundation for insightful analysis.

Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:

**Project Split:** I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.
**Potential Analysis & Questions:** From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.
**Preliminary Insights:** By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.
**Storytelling:** Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.
Industry & Stakeholders: This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.
